# 🚗 Ethical Risk Analysis in Autonomous Driving

This paper presents a **comprehensive ethical risk and benefit analysis** of autonomous driving, spanning all levels of automation, **from Level 0 (no automation) to Level 5 (full automation)**, as defined by the **Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE)**.

As **autonomous vehicles (AVs)** revolutionize transportation, they promise **enhanced road safety, environmental benefits, and a transformed travel experience**. However, they also introduce **complex ethical dilemmas**, from liability concerns to algorithmic biases. This report critically examines both the **potential advantages** and the **ethical challenges** posed by AV technology.

## ⚠️ Ethical & Practical Risks

### ⚖️ **1. Liability & Accountability**
- **Who is responsible in an accident?** The transition between **manual and automated control (Level 3 autonomy)** creates **legal and ethical ambiguity**.
- Lack of **clear regulations** complicates insurance claims and legal disputes.

### 🔒 **2. Cybersecurity & Privacy Concerns**
- AVs rely on **constant data exchange**—making them **vulnerable to hacking**.
- **Misuse of personal data** (e.g., tracking passenger movements) raises privacy issues.

### 🏥 **3. Bias & Discrimination in AI Decision-Making**
- AI-driven detection systems may **disproportionately misidentify or endanger** certain groups, such as **pedestrians with darker skin tones** or **people using mobility aids**.
- **Algorithmic bias** in emergency decision-making (e.g., whom to protect in a crash scenario) poses **serious ethical concerns**.

### 👷 **4. Job Displacement & Economic Impact**
- **Widespread automation threatens jobs** in sectors like trucking, taxis, and delivery services.
- However, AV technology also **creates new roles** in AI development, maintenance, and cybersecurity.
